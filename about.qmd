I'm Jasmine Chu, a fourth-year undergraduate student at UCLA, majoring in Statistics & Data Science and minoring in Film & Television. My academic background allows me to approach problems from both analytical and creative perspectives, combining data science with storytelling to bring unique insights and solutions.

Currently, I am focused on applying my skills in data analysis and statistical modeling to real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in how data-driven insights can influence decision-making in the entertainment industry.

When I'm not immersed in my studies, I enjoy dancing, video editing, hiking, going to concerts, and exploring new destinations! \newline
